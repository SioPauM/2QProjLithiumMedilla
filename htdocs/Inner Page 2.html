					<h4>Description: </h4>
					<p>At this stage, the hecticness and stress start creeping in a tiny bit. There is a steady increase in requirements which is sad but manageable.</p>
					<p>The time in which this stage occurs is usually before midterms. Plenty of heavy requirements is often announced at this time.</p>
					<p>The announcements of these heavy requirements signal that pain and suffering are approaching. Students will usually start doing more requirements at this time in order to deal with the increasing number of requirements.</p>
					<h4>Advised Course of Action: </h4>
					<p>People still need to do their reqs as quickly as possible since the surge of reqs is not going to stop any time soon.</p>
					<p>With midterms around the corner, it will get harder to keep up with the reqs. Try your best to do your reqs as swiftly and early as possible, and you should be fine. :â€™)</p>
