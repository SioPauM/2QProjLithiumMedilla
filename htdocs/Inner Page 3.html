					<h4>Description: </h4>
					<p>This stage is just full of stress. Midterms just finished and students are already dumped with a buttload of requirements. If you thought you could rest after midterms, you thought wrong. (iyak)</p>
					<p>The project deadlines are also nearing so the pressure to finish them increases. “Ayoko na” - Pau</p>
					<p>There are often plenty of regrets that are felt during this stage. Regrets such as not doing requirements early or forgetting about other requirements. Plenty of mental breakdowns are usually present during this stage due to the frustration and stress from requirements.</p>
					<h4>Advised Course of Action: </h4>
					<p>Try to just do reqs. It will feel endless and annoying but just answer your requirements when you can. It is really hard to do requirements since our homes are not really ideal for work and there are lots of distractions.  “Kaya natin to :’)” - Pau</p>
					<p>If you are having a really hard time and it’s out of your control, rest. Take some pressure off yourself.</p>
