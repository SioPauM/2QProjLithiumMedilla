					<h4>Description: </h4>
					<p>At this part of the cycle, it is thankfully very calm. You get a steady and easily manageable amount of requirements.</p>
					<p>Usually, at this stage, there is no stress and hecticness. That is the reason why this stage is one of the most enjoyable of the four. This stage usually happens at the start of a quarter.</p>
					<p>One of the biggest mistakes that can easily happen is that people will push back doing their reqs. This is because people start to think they have lots of time to do reqs. Though it is true they have a lot of time now, that quickly fades away.</p>
					<h4>Advised Course of Action: </h4>
					<p>It is advised that at this stage people do their reqs as quickly as possible because with Pisay there are always surprises.</p>
					<p>These surprises are sadly usually heavy reqs that require a lot of your time. Since we now live in a pandemic where we all have different situations at home, it is imperative that we try our best to adjust to our own situations.</p>

			<h4>Author's Note: </h4>
			<p>I usually do requirements casually and stall big requirements during this stage. Those big requirements are for future me to worry about. :'D <br>(self-love muna, self-hate nalang sa future)</p>
